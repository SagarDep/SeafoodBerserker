No ninjas, no fruit. Just heavy-metal Vikings who love to slice seafood!

Slice all the seafood from entering your Viking ship, but don't chop the anchors! It has two modes, "Classic" where you lose a life for each missed food, and "Arcade" where you just go for points.

I started this game a long time ago as a joke, but illness and family matters eventually made it so I couldn't finish it. So I just cleaned it up a bit and published it because I'm not sure when I'll get back to it! I hope someone can enjoy it!
